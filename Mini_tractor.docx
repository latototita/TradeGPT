If your mini-tractor will be running a gear connected to blade systems for cutting soil and dealing with small roots, the 36mm gear motor with 3.0Nm torque and various reduction ratios seems suitable. The gear system amplifies the motor's torque output, making it effective for cutting tasks.

Consider experimenting with different reduction ratios to find the right balance between torque and speed. Higher ratios increase torque for cutting dense soil, while lower ratios provide higher rotational speed for lighter tasks.

Ensure the blade design is durable and suitable for cutting soil and roots. Implement safety measures, overload protection, and motor control using the encoder (if available) for precise operation.

Allow blade height and angle adjustment to adapt to various soil conditions and cutting depths.

Thorough testing and prototyping are essential to fine-tune the mini-tractor's blade system for optimal performance in real-world soil cutting scenarios.

To power the 12V DC 36mm gear motor with 3.0Nm torque, follow these steps for solar panel and battery sizing:

Step 1: Calculate the power consumption of the motor using Power (Watts) = Voltage (Volts) * Current (Amperes). Assuming the motor draws 5A at max torque:
Power = 12V * 5A = 60 Watts

Step 2: Determine daily energy consumption. Assuming 4 hours of daily use:
Daily Energy Consumption = 60 Watts * 4 hours = 240 Wh

Step 3: Select the solar panel rating. Assuming 15% efficiency:
Solar Panel Rating = 240 Wh / 0.15 = 1600 Watts (1.6 kW)

Step 4: Determine the battery capacity for two days of autonomy:
Battery Capacity = (240 Wh * 2 days) / 12V = 40 Ah

For this setup, use two 800W 12V DC solar panels and a 12V DC battery with a capacity of at least 40Ah for two days of autonomy without recharging.

Assumptions and Optimal Levels:
- The 36mm gear motor with 3.0Nm torque is appropriate for cutting soil and handling small roots.
- The gear system effectively amplifies the motor's torque output.
- The selection of reduction ratios will optimize torque and speed based on different soil conditions.
- The blade design is durable and suitable for cutting soil and roots.
- Safety measures, overload protection, and motor control ensure precise and safe operation.
- Blade height and angle adjustment allows adaptation to various soil conditions and cutting depths.
- Thorough testing and prototyping will optimize the blade system's performance.
- For the solar panel and battery setup, two 800W 12V DC solar panels and a 12V DC battery with a capacity of at least 40Ah are recommended for two days of autonomy without recharging.

Note: For critical applications, consult a solar energy expert and an engineer to design a precise system that meets the mini-tractor's energy needs and ensures optimal performance during soil cutting operations.

If your mini-tractor will be running a gear connected to blade systems for cutting soil and dealing with small roots, the 36mm gear motor with 3.0Nm torque and various reduction ratios seems suitable. The gear system amplifies the motor's torque output, making it effective for cutting tasks.

Consider experimenting with different reduction ratios to find the right balance between torque and speed. Higher ratios increase torque for cutting dense soil, while lower ratios provide higher rotational speed for lighter tasks.

Ensure the blade design is durable and suitable for cutting soil and roots. Implement safety measures, overload protection, and motor control using the encoder (if available) for precise operation.

Allow blade height and angle adjustment to adapt to various soil conditions and cutting depths.

Thorough testing and prototyping are essential to fine-tune the mini-tractor's blade system for optimal performance in real-world soil cutting scenarios.

To power the 12V DC 36mm gear motor with 3.0Nm torque, follow these steps for solar panel and battery sizing:

Step 1: Calculate the power consumption of the motor using Power (Watts) = Voltage (Volts) * Current (Amperes). Assuming the motor draws 5A at max torque:
Power = 12V * 5A = 60 Watts

Step 2: Determine daily energy consumption. Assuming 4 hours of daily use:
Daily Energy Consumption = 60 Watts * 4 hours = 240 Wh

Step 3: Select the solar panel rating. Assuming 15% efficiency:
Solar Panel Rating = 240 Wh / 0.15 = 1600 Watts (1.6 kW)

Step 4: Determine the battery capacity for two days of autonomy:
Battery Capacity = (240 Wh * 2 days) / 12V = 40 Ah

For this setup, use two 800W 12V DC solar panels and a 12V DC battery with a capacity of at least 40Ah for two days of autonomy without recharging.





To calculate the gear arrangement, torque requirements, and efficiency for different gear ratios, consider the following parameters:

Motor Torque (T_motor): 3.0 Nm (maximum torque of the motor)
Blade Gear Diameter (D_blade): 25 cm
Blade Gear Weight (W_blade): 5 kg
Gearbox Efficiency (η_gearbox): Assume 85% efficiency for the gear arrangement.

Step 1: Determine Torque Requirements
Assume optimal resistance (torque required for cutting) as 5 Nm.

Step 2: Calculate Gear Ratio and Torque at 50% and 100% Function
Assume two gear ratios:
1. Gear Ratio 1 (GR1) for higher torque: 3:1
2. Gear Ratio 2 (GR2) for lower torque: 10:1

Calculate the torque required at each gear ratio:
T_required_GR1 = 5 Nm
T_required_GR2 = 5 Nm

Calculate the torque at 50% and 100% function for each gear ratio:
T_motor_50_percent = 1.5 Nm
T_motor_100_percent = 3.0 Nm

T_blade_GR1_50_percent = 4.5 Nm
T_blade_GR1_100_percent = 9.0 Nm
T_blade_GR2_50_percent = 15.0 Nm
T_blade_GR2_100_percent = 30.0 Nm

Step 3: Efficiency
Assume gearbox efficiency of 85% (η_gearbox = 0.85).

Step 4: Gear Arrangement Design
Design the gear arrangement for each gear ratio to achieve the required torque at the blade gear for 50% and 100% function of the motor.

Note: These calculations are based on assumptions and ideal scenarios. Real-world designs should consider factors like gear type, size, materials, and actual load conditions. Consult a mechanical engineer for an optimized and reliable blade system for your mini-tractor.

- Blade height and angle adjustment allows adaptation to various soil conditions and cutting depths.
- Thorough testing and prototyping will optimize the blade system's performance.
- For the solar panel and battery setup, two 800W 12V DC solar panels and a 12V DC battery with a capacity of at least 40Ah are recommended for two days of autonomy without recharging.

Note: For critical applications, consult a solar energy expert and an engineer to design a precise system that meets the mini-tractor's energy needs and ensures optimal performance during soil cutting operations.



The performance of the mini-tractor's blade system will vary at 50% and 100% function of the motor based on the selected gear ratios and the corresponding torque values.

At 50% Function:
1. Gear Ratio 1 (GR1) - Higher Torque: The mini-tractor will have relatively higher cutting force at 50% motor function with GR1, effective in cutting through softer soils and small roots. It might face limitations in cutting through denser or tougher soil conditions.
2. Gear Ratio 2 (GR2) - Lower Torque: The mini-tractor will have lower cutting force at 50% motor function with GR2. Suitable for lighter cutting tasks and simpler soil conditions, may struggle with denser soil or larger roots.

At 100% Function:
1. Gear Ratio 1 (GR1) - Higher Torque: The mini-tractor will have higher cutting force at 100% motor function with GR1, performing better in cutting through various soil types and dealing with medium-sized roots.
2. Gear Ratio 2 (GR2) - Lower Torque: The mini-tractor will have the highest cutting force at 100% motor function with GR2, capable of cutting through denser soil and larger roots more efficiently.

Overall Assessment:
- Performance depends on the chosen gear ratio and specific soil and root conditions.
- Higher gear ratio (GR2) provides more cutting force but lower speed, suitable for tougher tasks.
- Lower gear ratio (GR1) offers a balance between cutting force and speed, versatile for various cutting conditions.
- Conduct field tests with both ratios to evaluate real-world cutting efficiency.
- Fine-tune the blade system for optimal performance.
- Consult with an engineer to optimize the system for your gardening needs.
